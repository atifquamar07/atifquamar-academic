Currently working on making LLMs better reasoners at UC San Diego.  Previously, at Purdue University, my research focused on inference-time alignment for language models. I founded [Insituate](https://insituate.ai), where we built agentic systems used by global banks and financial institutions. I earned my bachelors in Computer Science and Bioscienes from [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in) in 2024, and have a deep passion for AI, particularly in exploring and expanding the capabilities of language models.

My research explores methods to enhance LLMs’ reasoning, generalization, and alignment with human goals by building AI systems that are adversarially robust, decision-transparent, and computationally efficient. While LLMs are a primary area of interest, I’m also open to exploring other areas that have the potential to significantly expand the capabilities of intelligent systems.
